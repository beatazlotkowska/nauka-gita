		<h1>TAARLO</h1>

		<p class="author"> by Herman de Coninck</p>

		<p>	We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.
		And in spring too I feel no different.
		We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves
		through much dark-red loss, appellation control√©e,
		</p>
		
		<p> that deepens in the cellar of the years.
		We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.
		Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees
		sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.
		</p>

		<p> 33, and in the midst of the dark wood
		of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,
		at home in the woods and desolate at home. 
		</p>

		<p> Will we one day, maybe, ever?
		The summer is past, the hay-making is over.
		The here is nowhere, and the now is never. 
		</p>
		<p> Idk what to say...
		</p>
